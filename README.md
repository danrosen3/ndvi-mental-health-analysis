# NDVI & Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline examining the relationship between early adulthood green space exposure (measured using NDVI â€” Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and later-life risk of dementia and depression among older adults.

The analysis uses data from the **All of Us Research Program Controlled Tier Dataset (v8)** and integrates geospatial, clinical, and socioeconomic information. Results are summarized in figures and tables suitable for publication.
